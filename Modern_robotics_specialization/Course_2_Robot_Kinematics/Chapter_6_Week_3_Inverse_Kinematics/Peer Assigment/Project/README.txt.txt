README
This is Course 2 modern robotics Robot Kinematics Final project in week 3 
this file consist of:

file "code" consist of "project.py" implements IKinBodyIteration modified function 
"log.txt" contains the console output.
"iteration.csv" contains the joint values for each iteration.
file "Documentation" consist of "screenshot.png" and "video.avi"
"screenshot.png" shows the final robot configuration in CoppeliaSim.
"screenshot1.png" shows the final robot configuration in CoppeliaSim with the matrix SE(3).
"video.avi" is a video of the robot moving to the final configuration from iterative Newton-Raphson solutions in CoppeliaSim.

to run the program open the Shell in windows or command and run it with the python.In this version code it is still need manually copy the log output to the log.txt
